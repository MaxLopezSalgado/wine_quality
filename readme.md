# Blueberry Winery Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing datasets provided by Blueberry Winery, a portuguese wine producer company. Through a series of data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML) techniques, valuable insights were extracted from the data.

## Key Highlights
- Conducted thorough data wrangling and data cleaning to ensure data quality and accuracy.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models and gain deeper insights.
- Created visually appealing and informative geographical visualizations to better understand the data and consumer behavior.

By applying these techniques, we gained valuable insights into wine quality producing patterns, chemichal correlations between different quality wines, and other important factors that can drive business decisions for Blueberry Winery.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
